## 3DGUT Rasterizer (FlashSplat copy)

- Path: `flashsplat/threedgut_flashsplat_tracer`
- Source: `thirdparty/3DGRUT-ArtiFixer/threedgut_tracer` @ 62e1038b74b2edc01440fd4ddf5f080109b6faba
- Repository: https://github.com/nv-tlabs/3DGRUT-ArtiFixer
- License: Apache-2.0

A copy of the 3DGUT rasterizer, modified to accumulate per-Gaussian alpha-blending weights
per mask label. It builds as a separate torch extension and leaves the submodule untouched.
See `flashsplat/threedgut_flashsplat_tracer/README.md` for the exact set of changes.

## FlashSplat

- Path: `flashsplat/solver.py`, and the accumulation hook in `flashsplat/threedgut_flashsplat_tracer`
- Source: "FlashSplat: 2D to 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation Solved Optimally" (ECCV 2024),
  https://github.com/florinshen/FlashSplat
- License: see the upstream repository

`flashsplat/solver.py` is a port of `multi_instance_opt` from the FlashSplat reference
implementation. The rasterizer hook implements the same per-Gaussian, per-label
accumulation of `alpha * transmittance` that FlashSplat adds to the 3DGS rasterizer.

## Inpaint360GS

- Path: `inpaint360gs/`
- Source: "Inpaint360GS: Efficient Object-Aware 3D Inpainting via Gaussian Splatting for 360°
  Scenes" (WACV 2026), https://github.com/dfki-av/Inpaint360GS @ d54c893
- License: Apache-2.0

`inpaint360gs/` ports the official pipeline (mask association, identity distillation, object
removal, virtual camera poses, LaMa inpainting setup, Gaussian initialisation and inpainting
finetune) onto 3DGUT. `inpaint360gs/lama.py` also ports LaMa's feature refinement
(`saicinpainting/evaluation/refinement.py`, https://github.com/advimman/lama, Apache-2.0).
